0. Create a three-dimensional array of integers.
Use loops to "go through" the entire array and increase each
element by a given number. Let the number by which
each element will increase be set from the console.

1*. Chessboard
Create a program for coloring a chessboard using a loop.
Create a two-dimensional array of 8x8 Strings. Use loops to set
the values of B(Black) or W(White) for the elements of the loops. The result of
the program:
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W

2*. Multiplication of two matrices
Create two arrays of 3x3 integers (two matrices).
Write a program to multiply two matrices.
The first array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
The second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
The expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 0 0 0

3. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Print the sum
of all the array elements to the console.
